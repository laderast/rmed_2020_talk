\abstract{%
Teaching Data Analytics in Healthcare is difficult to teach effectively,
especially to Clinical Professionals. In this article, we outline our
Data Analytics course, which we have delivered for 6 years, and our
strategies for effective learning.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Delivering analytics effectively in healthcare is a difficult concept to
teach effectively. Key practical data science skills (such as querying,
visualizing, and modeling real data) must be combined with
organizational thinking. In this article, we outline our Data Analytics
course which focuses two aspects of analytics: organizational
considerations and practical R skills.

This course is unique in that it has both clinical informatics and
bioinformatics students within our departments. We take advantage of
this mixed audience to build a support structure for both the clinicians
and the bioinformatics students.

By the end of the course, our students must synthesize both of these
branches by querying and modeling the data and present their results to
an Executive team.

\hypertarget{clinicians-as-learners}{%
\subsection{Clinicians as Learners}\label{clinicians-as-learners}}

In our past 6 years teaching the course, we have honed our understanding
of clinicians as learners. We have built our learner persona as Mary:

\begin{quote}
Mary is a clinician who wants to understand how analytics can be
delivered in her healthcare organization. She \emph{has little time},
and likes \emph{learning on her own}. She has a \emph{hard time asking
for help} and can be overly self critical.
\end{quote}

We have tailored the material in the course to accommodate the learners
{[}in the following ways{]}:

\emph{Has little time} - our assignments utilize a lot of ``just in
time'' instruction. For instance, each assignment focuses on a key
concept that builds on previous concepts, such as single table queries
first, followed by table joins, and self-joins. Additionally, the
assignments slowly increase in difficulty.

\emph{Likes learning on her own} - all assignments are delivered as
RMarkdown documents within Rstudio projects and distributed via
RStudio.cloud. The ease of setup with RStudio.cloud gets our students up
and running relatively quickly. Delivering individual assignments as
projects allows us to pace the tempo of learning, and focus them on
particular topics.

\emph{Asking for help}. We attempt to destigmatize asking for help with
the following strategies: team-based learning, office hours, and
individual appointments.

\hypertarget{simulating-data-analytics}{%
\subsection{Simulating Data Analytics}\label{simulating-data-analytics}}

Our course centers around a single analytical task: predicting
readmissions in a simulated patient population using a validated metric,
LACE. {[}{]} LACE is short for

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{L}ength of Stay
\item
  \textbf{Acuity} of Admission
\item
  \textbf{Comorbidities}
\item
  \textbf{Emergency Room} Visits
\end{itemize}

In order to calculate these, a number of assignments center around
exploring, extracting, querying, summarizing, modeling, and presenting
the patient information (Figure @ref(fig:assignments)).

The expectation is that students not only utilize their practical
skills, but make it understandable to an executive team. Our assignments
center around querying and calculating the LACE metric for a simulated
clinical warehouse. This clinical warehouse is stored as a SQLite
Database and is accessed through the R Projects using the \texttt{DBI}
and \texttt{RSQLite} packages. It represents a clinical extract of
patients admitted into the hospital, along with their diagnoses.

The assignments progress in order of difficulty:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Use tools such as \texttt{visdat} and
\texttt{skimr} to explore the structure of the tables in the data
warehouse and missing values. (Figure @ref(fig:assignments)a)

SQL Queries: start with simple one table queries, graduate to multi join
queries, including self-joins and counts (Figure @ref(fig:assignments)b)

Calculating individual components: calculate and document how to
calculate each component of the LACE Score.

Modeling: build a logistic regression model or a machine learning model
to predict readmission in the simulated patient population (Figure
@ref(fig:assignments)c).

Presenting/Interpretation: interpret a model meaningfully in a way that
aligns with organizational goals in a way that is accessible to
executives. In order to facilitate this, we have developed lectures both
in organizational considerations in presenting data, and a section on
data storytelling with visuals.

\hypertarget{organizational-skills-and-challenges}{%
\subsection{Organizational Skills and
Challenges}\label{organizational-skills-and-challenges}}

Equally important skills for Analysts are effectively aligning analytic
projects to the strategic goals within an organization (Figure
@ref(fig:organization)). To this end, we provide lectures in finding
organizational sponsors, establishing analytic priorities, understanding
organizational dynamics and culture, change management in an
organization, evaluating the clinical utility of a metric, as well as
the lifecycle of analytic projects in an organization. These lectures
are supplemented by reading assignments {[}{]} and online and in-class
discussion of these topics.

The lectures are delivered by guest lecturers from Kaiser Permanente,
who share their experiences of working as an effective analytic team
within Kaiser Permanente. Most importantly, the experience of
implementing LACE as a useful metric within KP is highlighted. The first
implementation was a failure, and students get the opportunity to learn
about why the implementation was not successful. The second
implementation of LACE highlights the essential change management skills
needed to make LACE a success within Kaiser. Students have found these
lectures to be helpful in understanding the context.

Students have been highly receptive to the course. In a recent
curriculum committee meeting, both the Clinical and Bioinformatics
student representatives recommended that this course be taught to all
students in the department.
