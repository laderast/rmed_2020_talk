Assignments are delivered as projects in RStudio Cloud within the Data Analytics Workspace.

We do our best to assess student performance and identify any difficulties with students. 

Clinicians tend to be hard on themselves.

# Themes: Collaboration

Taking the Data Analytics course made me a .b[much more patient and effective collaborator], especially when working with colleagues outside of science.

# Themes: Diversity

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[I highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to get a comprehensive introduction to R and the field of data analytics. .b[The course attracts [a] very diverse set of students.] The hybrid nature of the course was ideal to get to meet and network with others.

# Themes: Soup to Nuts

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[I would definitely recommend this to .b[anyone who is interested in working with data in a healthcare setting], whether you’re a clinician/researcher who will be gathering and using the data, or a manager who might be presenting the data or incorporating analytics into your organization’s workflow.

# Themes: The Future

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
As a clinician, to see how a data analysis works and how algorithms result in a recommendation was very helpful.

... informatics programs .b[should expand their technical analytics courses for clinicians and other clinical informatics students]. Perhaps some day there will be a formal role for clinician-data scientists in the healthcare industry outside of research, and if there will be it starts with courses like this.

# We won an award!

## 2020 Sakai Torchbearer Award

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Nominations praised the careful curriculum, .b[responsive and available instructors] (including those drawn from outside of OHSU), .b[meticulously planned projects], and the use of R notebooks and RStudio, resulting in .b[essential research skills] “not only in bioinformatics/computer science, but generally across biology and medicine.” 

Lastly, nominators said that Dr. Laderas offers generous feedback and considerable time to supporting learners with these projects through multiple technical modalities.]

# Conclusions

- Course combines practical and organizational skills 
- Talk about real life lessons
- Apply that knowledge
