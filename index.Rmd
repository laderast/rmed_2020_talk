# Overview

- Our course
- How we did it
- Outcomes

---

class: center, middle
# How do you deliver actionable analytics in healthcare?

---
# Build to a Final Presentation

- Execute a pilot study of a metric (LACE)
- Assess its effectiveness in a patient population
- Report the next steps to executive team

---
# Getting There

Two focuses on this course:

- Organizational Aspects
	- Lessons learned from Kaiser Permanente Insight Analysts
- Data Science (R)
	- ETL (SQL/tidyverse)
	- Predictive Modeling (broom/tidymodels)

---
# Lower the Barrier

- Start with RStudio.cloud
- Content is delivered as RStudio Projects 
- Students submit their assignments as knitted Rmarkdown   
- Provide lots of opportunities to ask for help

---
# The Predictive Problem

  - Predict 30 day readmissions in a simulated patient cohort
  - Use a validated metric (LACE) on the dataset
  - Communicate its effectiveness in a patient population

---
# The Data

- Simulated Data Warehouse
- 4 Month Extract of patients
- Based on real clinical data

---
# Data Science Skills Learned

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- SQL Queries
- Visualization
- Predictive Modeling 
	- Logistic Regression
- Communicating Results
	- ROC curves
	- Interpreting models

# Student Testimonies
---
# Themes: Collaboration

> Taking the Data Analytics course made me a much more patient and effective collaborator, especially when working with colleagues outside of science. - Kristen Stevens

---
# Themes: Diversity

> I highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to get a comprehensive introduction to R and the field of data analytics. The course attracts [a] very diverse set of students. The hybrid nature of the course was ideal to get to meet and network with others. - Meenakashi Mishra

---
# Themes: Soup to Nuts

> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in working with data in a healthcare setting, whether you’re a clinician/researcher who will be gathering and using the data, or a manager who might be presenting the data or incorporating analytics into your organization’s workflow. - Pierrette Lo

# We won an award!

2020 Sakai Torchbearer Award

> Nominations praised the careful curriculum, responsive and available instructors (including those drawn from outside of OHSU), meticulously planned projects, and the use of R notebooks and RStudio, resulting in essential research
skills “not only in bioinformatics/computer science, but generally across biology and medicine.” 

> Lastly, nominators said that Dr. Laderas offers generous feedback and considerable time to supporting learners with these projects through multiple technical modalities.
