Assignments are delivered as projects in RStudio Cloud within the Data Analytics Workspace.

We do our best to assess student performance and identify any difficulties with students. 

Clinicians tend to be hard on themselves.

# Themes: Collaboration

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Taking the Data Analytics course made me a .b[much more patient and effective collaborator], especially when working with colleagues outside of science.

# We won an award!

## 2020 Sakai Torchbearer Award

Nominations praised the careful curriculum, .b[responsive and available instructors] (including those drawn from outside of OHSU), .b[meticulously planned projects], and the use of R notebooks and RStudio, resulting in .b[essential research skills] “not only in bioinformatics/computer science, but generally across biology and medicine.” 

Lastly, nominators said that Dr. Laderas offers generous feedback and considerable time to supporting learners with these projects through multiple technical modalities.
