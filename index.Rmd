# Challenges: Very Different Backgrounds

- Bioinformatics/Clinical students
- Pair them up and have them teach each other

---
# Challenges: Getting People used to R/Pacing

- [Ready for R]()
- Have fail-safes
- Office Hours
- Slack

---
# Challenges: There is no right answer

- Only more defensible ones
- Get students to document

# Student Testimonies
---
# Themes: Collaboration

> Taking the Data Analytics course made me a **much more patient and effective collaborator**, especially when working with colleagues outside of science. - Kristen Stevens

---
# Themes: Diversity

> I highly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to get a comprehensive introduction to R and the field of data analytics. **The course attracts [a] very diverse set of students.** The hybrid nature of the course was ideal to get to meet and network with others. - Meenakashi Mishra

---
# Themes: Soup to Nuts

> I would definitely recommend this to **anyone who is interested in working with data in a healthcare setting**, whether you’re a clinician/researcher who will be gathering and using the data, or a manager who might be presenting the data or incorporating analytics into your organization’s workflow. - Pierrette Lo

# We won an award!

## 2020 Sakai Torchbearer Award

> Nominations praised the careful curriculum, **responsive and available instructors** (including those drawn from outside of OHSU), **meticulously planned projects**, and the use of R notebooks and RStudio, resulting in **essential research skills** “not only in bioinformatics/computer science, but generally across biology and medicine.” 

> Lastly, nominators said that Dr. Laderas offers generous feedback and considerable time to supporting learners with these projects through multiple technical modalities.
